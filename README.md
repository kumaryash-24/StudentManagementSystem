## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   **JDK** (Java Development Kit) 11 or higher
*   **Apache Tomcat** 9.0 or higher
*   **MySQL** Database Server
*   An IDE like **Eclipse** or IntelliJ IDEA

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/StudentManagementSystem.git
    ```

2.  **Import the project** into your favorite IDE (e.g., as a Maven project in Eclipse).

3.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Open your MySQL client (like HeidiSQL or MySQL Workbench).
    *   Run the following SQL script to create the database and table:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS student_db;
        USE student_db;
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS students (
            roll_number INT PRIMARY KEY,
            name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
            student_class VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
        );
        ```

4.  **Configure the Database Connection:**
    *   Open the `src/main/java/com/example/controller/StudentController.java` file.
    *   Update the `PASSWORD` constant with your actual MySQL root password:
        ```java
        private static final String PASSWORD = "your_password_here";
        ```

5.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Configure your Apache Tomcat server in your IDE.
    *   Right-click the project and select **Run As > Run on Server**.
    *   The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8080/StudentManagementSystem/`.

## üèõÔ∏è Project Structure

The project follows the MVC architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

*   **Model:** `com.example.bean.Student.java` - The Java Bean that represents the student data structure.
*   **View:** All `.jsp` files (`index.jsp`, `viewStudents.jsp`, etc.) and the `style.css` file - Responsible for the user interface.
*   **Controller:** `com.example.controller.StudentController.java` - The Servlet that handles all user requests, interacts with the database, and controls the application flow.
